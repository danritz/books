# Notes on the Synthesis of Form
Christopher Alexander (1964)

***

> There is a good deal of superstition among designers as to the deathly effect of analysis on their intuitions — with the  unfortunate result that very few designers have tried to understand the process of design analytically.

The longer I’m a designer the more alarming it is to meet other designers that desire freedom more than constraint. It’s better to know the situation and context where and how your work will be used. This is bound to collect constraints.

> Enormous resistance to the idea of systematic processes of design is coming from people who recognize correctly the importance of intuition, but then make a fetish of it which excludes the possibility of asking reasonable questions.

Building systematic process doesn’t prevent you from using your intuition. I often feel this tension and get in my own way. Sometimes I fight my intuition. Other times I fight the process. I eventually realize I’m fighting imagined constraints. I never promised to only use the existing process. No one has ever asked me to not use my intuition.

> It is based on the idea that every design problem begins with an effort to achieve fitness between two entities: the form in question and its context. The form is the solution to the problem; the context defines the problem.

I continually have to remind myself to anchor my thinking to the present. The problem isn’t in the future. Saying someone *should* be able to do something is explaining a future scenario. How do you know they should do it? How do you know they can’t do it now? You have to find the disfunction (misfit) between the person and their world. This is entirely in the present. No need to imagine the future. Not yet.

> In such cases there is no design problem. *What does make design a problem in real world cases is that we are trying to make a diagram for forces whose field we do not understand.* Understanding the field of the context and inventing a form to fit it are really two aspects of the same process.

This captures my fear of upfront design. You can’t reasonably understand the form that should fit the situation without participating in the situation to some degree. Simulations and prototypes help, but they don’t pull nearly as much risk and ambiguity out of a situation as most people tend to believe.

> If we agree to treat fit as the absence of misfits, and to use a list of those potential misfits which are most likely to occur as our criterion for fit, our theory will at least have the same nature as our intuitive conviction that there is a problem to be solved.

The language of fit and misfit makes so much more sense to me than problems and solutions. I know it’s all semantics, but I wonder if our desire to find significant problems keeps us from spotting obvious, but less dramatic misfits. Something has to be deeply “wrong” for us to pay attention. We, then, find ways to manufacture scenarios to make exaggerate problems.

> Unselfconscious cultures contain, as a feature of their form-producing systems, a certain built-in fixity — patterns of myth, tradition, taboo which resist willful change. Form-builders will only introduce changes under strong compulsion where there are powerful (and obvious) irritations in the existing forms which demand correction.

All the talk of culture and principles often feels more abstract than necessary. It can often simply be a set of things unlikely to change, even when they appear to be counterproductive. We believe the long-term potential is more beneficial than the short-term friction. Look for places of friction where people aren’t interested in change. You’ll find the real culture. The real principles.

> However, for this fit to occur in practice, one vital condition must be satisfied. It must have time to happen. The process must be able to achieve its equilibrium before the next culture change upsets it again. It must actually have time to reach its equilibrium every time it is disturbed — or, if we see the process as continuous rather than intermittent, the adjustment of forms must proceed more quickly than the drift of cultural context. Unless this condition is fulfilled the system can never produce well-fitting forms, for the equilibrium of the adaptation will not be satisfied.

I’m convinced in the power of moving fast and continually improving your product. Although, without stability of usage you can never really know if you’re making things better or worse. Many small changes widely distributed are often better than big, dramatic changes.

> It is just the fast reaction to single failures, completed by resistance to all other change, which allows the process to make series of minor adjustments instead of spasmodic global ones: it is able to adjust subsystem by subsystem, so that the process of adjustment is faster than the rate at which the culture changes; equilibrium is certain to re-establish whenever slight disturbances occur; and the forms are not simply well-fitted to their cultures, but in active equilibrium with them.

Needing to make big changes is a sign you’ve been neglecting misfits and have allowed them to fester into full-blown problems. Problems require big changes that break people’s equilibrium between their world and your product. The word “redesign” should make designers cringe. It means you haven’t been paying attention to to the people using your product.

> A diagram which expresses requirements alone or form alone is no help in effecting the translation of requirements into form, and will not play any constructive part in the search for form.

I’m continually tricked by clear documents describing an area of concern. My brain can understand the point and the purpose of the documents and forget that humans are full of delightful contradictions. The only way to understand how something is used, is to watch it be used. Extrapolate from present use, instead of speculating on future use.

> Every form can be described in two ways: from the point of view of of what it is, and the point of view of what it does. What it is is sometimes called the formal description. What it does is called a functional description.

I love this. It’s painfully obvious. Although, we seem to find formal description adequate in conversations, planning, and building. As predictable as the sun rising, we’re caught off guard by human nature. We should always take the time to describe what our product is, but we should never skip describing what our product does — what our product helps people do.

> We cannot decide whether a misfit has occurred either by looking at the form alone, or by looking at the context alone. Misfit is a condition of the ensemble as a whole, which comes from the unsatisfactory interaction of the form and context.

Another reminder that you don’t, and can’t, really know wether or not something will satisfy people until people use it. It’s important to anchor to satisfaction, not right or wrong, or broken or fixed, or good or bad. Many flaws can remain, while still satisfying somebody. Or have none, and satisfy nobody.

> For most requirements it is important only to satisfy them at a level which suffices to prevent misfit between the form and context, and to do this in the least arbitrary manner possible.

Least arbitrary manner possible. This may be my favorite phrase in the book. Minimum viable product? No thanks. Subtle, but profound. It’s not doing the least amount of work to make something people care about. It’s improving people’s lives without making them shift and change and adapt in ways they don’t understand.
