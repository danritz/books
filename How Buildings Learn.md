# How Buildings Learn
by Stewart Brand

> Almost no buildings adapt well. They’re *designed* not to adapt; also budgeted and financed not to, constructed not to, administered not to, maintained not to, regulated and taxed not to, even remodeled not to. But all buildings (except monuments) adapt anyway, however poorly, because the usages in and around them are changing constantly.

This illustrates how the inertia around a building contributes to it being maladaptive to its environment. In software, we can design the application to adapt and change. Unfortunately, when we become “agile” without changing the system around us, it’s likely we will remain static.

> Along with their practical durability, they show age honestly and elegantly, as successive washings fade and shrink them to perfect fit and rich texture. Ingenious techniques to simulate aging of denim come and go, but the basic indigo 502s, copper riveted, carry for decades. This is highly evolved design. Are there blue-jeans buildings among us? How does design honestly honor time?

Are there blue-jeans applications among us? Truly great design requires an astonishing amount of use and adaptation. Most will create an adequate pair of blu-jeans, then jump to an adequate jacket. Then adequate shorts. Nothing ever reaching greatness while adequate ideas fall in and out of favor — distracting from the chance to be great.

> Every university has similar stories. Temporary is permanent, and permanent is temporary. Grand, final-solution buildings obsolesce and have to be torn down because they were too overspecified to their original purpose to adapt easily to anything else. Temporary buildings are thrown up quickly and roughly to house temporary projects. Those projects move on soon enough, but they are immediately supplanted by other temporary projects — of which, it turns out, there is an endless supply.

If every project is supplanted by a new project without considerations of the past, no process can emerge to absorb a emerging themes in an ecosystem. The building will always be in a state of chaos. This is the fear of incremental thinking — constant chaos with little chance of meaningful progress. This happens when the current increment is designed without past increments in mind. This happens when we don’t learn from the variation of past increments.

> Individuals of opportunistic species are typically small, short-lived, and independent, putting all their energy into productivity. Preserver species are more often large, long-lived, densely interdependent and competitive, rationing their energy for high efficiency.

I love this spectrum. Through the lifetime of any meaningful venture the pendulum will swing to each side. Where you fight to spend your time says a lot about what you’re trying to build.

> When the height of fashion moves on, they’re the ones left behind, stuck in a building that was designed to look good rather than work well, and now it doesn’t even look good. They spend their day trapped in someone else’s taste, which everyone agrees is bad taste.

It’s easy, especially in hindsight, to complain about trends. It’s hard, especially ahead of time, to understand the risk of catering to trends. There aren’t many things as permanent as buildings. They’re aren’t many things as replaceable as clothes. Whatever we’re building, we should evaluate the risk of trends accordingly.

> Matisse Enzer, a contractor who has worked with [Christopher] Alexander, agrees: “Architects think of a building as a complete *thing*, while builders thing of it and know it as a *sequence* — hole, then foundation, framing, roof, etc. The separation of design from making has resulted in a built environment that has no ‘flow’ to it — you simply cannot design an improvisation or an adaptation. It’s dead.”

As you begin to use the space, you’re likely to better understand how you’ll interact with the space. If you can’t exploit these realizations as you go, it’s unlikely you’ll build something great. The progress of building needs to include the constant flow of new information.

> The opposite strategy is much surer, because the errors are piecemeal and correctable. When you proceed deliberately, mistakes don’t cascade, they instruct. Low risk *plus time* equals high gain. This strategy treats the fundamentals of the living investment with attention and respect. The less of realty laced with reality is: “Get rich slow.”

When you don’t give yourself the space to correct mistakes, the likelihood of catastrophic failure jumps dramatically. This seems true with everything. Starting companies, starting projects, starting friendships, starting families. Everything.

> What do the linked debacles of deep office buildings, sealed office buildings, and “smart” office buildings have in common? Each was a clever and comprehensive design solution, but each tried to solve just one primary problem and acted as if  the problem would hold still over time. These were classic cases of overspecificity, over centralized control, and “tight fit.” Each took a conspicuous trend of the moment — open offices in the 1960s, energy efficiency in the 1970s, information technology in the 1980s — and, at astronomical cost, shaped whole buildings tightly around it. When the trends moved on, the buildings were left standing, good at something that no one wanted any more. Their failure is the failure of optimization as a design strategy.

Failure of optimization as a design strategy. Interesting. I like this framing. The strategy in all of these examples is catering to something with an unknown point of satisfaction. Too much of something can be more frustrating than not enough of something. When are you committing too much resources to a strategy at the expense of others? How do you know when to stop? How do you know when to adjust and adapt? You can’t know ahead of time. You need to build in a way where you can spot the crossing of thresholds as they happen.

> Where a plan is based on prediction, a strategy is designed to encompass unforeseeably changing conditions. A good strategy ensures that, no matter what happens, you always have maneuvering room.

In complex environments you can prepare for something to happen, but you can’t rigidly plan. For example, you can prepare for rain on a camping trip. Although you can’t know, in any meaningful way, when it will rain and for how long. Will it happen before lunch? If so, will it be done before lunch? Planning can be helpful when you have several plans that account for local conditions. The goal, however, shouldn’t be to have a single driving plan.

> The iron rule of planning is: whatever a client or an architect says will happen with a building, won’t. Architects always want to control the future. So do clients. A big, physical building seems a perfect way to bind the course of future events. (“Once we move the company into the new building, then we can use it to limit our growth.”) It never works. The future is no more controllable than it is predictable. The only reliable attitude to take toward the future is that it is profoundly, structurally, unavoidably perverse. The rest of the iron run is: whatever you are ready for, doesn’t happen; whatever you are unready for, does.

So true. This is exacerbated the more you attempt to exert control on the future. Whenever something is build to control a situation it creates an artificial dependency. It’s a new variable to manage. It makes planning more complex. When something ends up not working, there is more to consider and manage. There’s more expense. There’s a higher chance of catastrophic failure.

> Furthermore, anything borrowed from local vernacular design is bound to look conservative — for the very reason that it is familiar, well-tried, nuanced product of local climate, local culture, and standard building use.

The things that are most likely to work and be a solid foundation for future work, often looks boring. Our desire to look into the unknown to make progress is often exactly what keeps us from making progress. If it’s a known frustration, there’s probably a known way to resolve that frustration. It just hasn’t been put to good use yet. It just hasn’t been built for large audiences yet. It just hasn’t been spotted by people thinking on a larger scale. Go talk to the locals.

> Some say you should flee a building while it is being finished or remodeled. I recommend occupying it. Bad as the inconvenience and aggravation get, it’s worthwhile for the fine-tuning that only presence at the worksite affords.

A “minimum viable product” is frustrating. At first glance it seems obvious what is missing and what should be done. Why don’t we just do it? Take a breath. Before you build into your imagination, interact with reality. Even if you end up doing something similar to the original thought — it will be more elegant. This is how our work goes from good to great.

> It’s a waste to do anything for just one reason. Besides serving its immediate purpose, Alexander suggests, each project should serve a larger goal of “healing the whole.” And it should prepare for a larger and more significant whole.

An incremental change have non-incremental results when it simplifies, consolidates, or clarifies a larger purpose or process. When there’s more that can be done with less thought, energy, or time. Every time you hope to locally improve something, deliberate effort should be put into how it can also be a global improvement.

> What made Architecture allergic to time? What made Architecture afraid of building users? How did style obsession and the star-architect system manage to keep redominating the profession? Get down to cases — what exactly is the performance record of buildings that won architectural awards? What is the effect of rewarding bad performance?

It seems like software is clawing its way out of a similar situation. I hope we know well enough to prevent it from reoccurring like it has with architecture several times. When we reward bad behavior — shipping, for example — we not only build poor quality software, we let vanity goals creep back into our strategic thinking. We accelerate the vicious cycle.

> Evolutionary design is healthier than visionary design.

So, so good.
